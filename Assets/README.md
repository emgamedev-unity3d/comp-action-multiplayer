# Competitive Action Multiplayer template

The Competitive Action Multiplayer game contains a first-person-shooter (FPS) game loop where you can fire a weapon at other players, die, re-spawn, and restart.

## Session info
The ping value is being calculated with an EstimatedRTT (see documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.netcode@1.3/api/Unity.NetCode.NetworkSnapshotAck.html#Unity_NetCode_NetworkSnapshotAck_EstimatedRTT). 
It can therefore increase due to network latency, tick rate and the Transport processing time.
